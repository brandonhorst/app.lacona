Lacona 2 is the successor to Lacona which launched in 2015. It is a ground-up rewrite, featuring a brand new language parsing engine, addon system, and UI. The rewrite is focused on speed, security, simplicity, and usability.

Lacona 2 will always be available for free. In the future, some advanced features will be available for a small subscription to support continued development. Lacona 1 will remain available on Setapp until Lacona 2 reaches approximate feature parity, at which point the Setapp version will be updated.
