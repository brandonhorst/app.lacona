---

Today is a big day for Lacona! [Lacona Pro](/faq#pro) is now available, including some amazing integrations with [Things](https://culturedcode.com), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app), [Lungo](https://sindresorhus.com/lungo), [Yoink](https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/mac/), and Twitter.

This coincides with Lacona 2's launch on [Setapp](https://setapp.com/apps/lacona), which has Lacona Pro included. Ulysses, Lungo, and Yoink are also available on Setapp, so Lacona makes the perfect companion!

To promote this, Lacona is up on Product Hunt today. Check it out!
